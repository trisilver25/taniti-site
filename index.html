                <h2>About the Island</h2>
                <p>Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of less than 500
                    square miles, the terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe
                    harbor, lush tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano.
                    Taniti has an indigenous population of about 20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most the
                    Tanitian economy was dominated by fishing or agriculture.</p>
